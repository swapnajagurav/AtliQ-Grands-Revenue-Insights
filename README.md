# AtliQ-Grands-Revenue-Insights
Power BI Dashboard for AtliQ Grands Revenue Insights — Codebasics Resume Project Challenge #1. Created key hotel performance KPIs using DAX and designed interactive visuals to uncover revenue opportunities and improve decision making.

## 📘 Project Overview
AtliQ Grands is a five-star hotel chain across India that has been operating successfully for over 20 years.  
Recently, the company has faced a **decline in market share and revenue** due to increasing competition and ineffective decision-making.  
As a data analyst, I designed a Power BI dashboard to help the management team make data-driven decisions to optimize revenue and performance.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Build and calculate key business metrics as per stakeholder mock-up.  
- Design an interactive Power BI dashboard for better decision-making.  
- Generate additional insights beyond the provided metric list to discover hidden opportunities.

## 💡 Key Insights
Through detailed analysis of AtliQ Grands’ historical data, several valuable insights were uncovered:
- **Mumbai** emerged as the top-performing city, contributing the highest revenue of ₹661M, followed by **Bangalore**, **Hyderabad**, and **Delhi** — indicating strong market potential in metro cities.  
- Among all hotel properties, **AtliQ Exotica** stood out with ₹317M in revenue, a solid average rating of 3.62, and a 57.20% occupancy rate.
- **AtliQ Blu** achieved the highest occupancy at **61.92%**, highlighting effective capacity utilization and strong customer engagement in that location.  
- **Week 29** recorded the **peak revenue (₹139.73M)** across all weeks, possibly driven by seasonal or event-based demand surges.  
- **Delhi** demonstrated strong operational performance, leading in both **occupancy rate** and **customer rating**, followed closely by **Hyderabad**, **Mumbai**, and **Bangalore**.    

These insights collectively help the management focus on **improving customer experience**, **optimizing pricing strategies**, and **reducing cancellations** to boost overall profitability.
